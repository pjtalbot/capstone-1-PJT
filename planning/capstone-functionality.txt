Way for user to upload gifs of signs, automatically add id to local database.

Store gif urls in db NOT just giphy id?
What's the most efficient way to store the data? 
  storing actual gif urls will increase the amount of data in my db
  BUT will reduce the amount of api calls

Search:
    use giphy search endpoint
    accept string from user
    add "sign language" or "american sign language" to query

    Example response: see exampleResponse.json

    search for milk:

    let searchAPI = async (str) => {
      
      let results = await axios.get('https://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/search?api_key=fW0yRyklR4H8mUX5pf1YF8EXsbeBpFc6&q=milk+sign+language&limit=2&offset=0&rating=g&lang=en')
      return results.data
    }
